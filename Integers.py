#1st test of integer 
x= 1
y= 2
z=x+y
print(z)

#2nd test, Is it string or Integers
# Ask to input x and y
x= input("Please type x: ")
y= input("Please type y: ")
#Calcuate with "+"
z= x+y
#Printing out the result of x+y
print(z)

#2nd test, Correcting correct data type
# Ask to input x and y

x= input("Please type x: ")
y= input("Please type y: ")
#Calcuate with "+" by defining x and y are integers
z= int(x)+int(y)
#Printing out the result of x+y
print(z)
